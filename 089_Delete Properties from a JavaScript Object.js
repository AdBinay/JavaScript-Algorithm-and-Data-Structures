// Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object

/*
We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark;
Example:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;
After the last line shown above, ourDog looks like:

{
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
} */

/*
Delete the tails property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation. */

// Setup
const myDog = {
    "name": "Happy Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
    "bark": "woof"
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
delete myDog.tails
