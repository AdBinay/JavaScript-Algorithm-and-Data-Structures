// Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation


/* 
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

const myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};

myObj["Space Name"];
myObj['More Space'];
myObj["NoSpace"];
myObj["Space Name"] would be the string Kirk, myObj['More Space'] would be the string Spock, and myObj["NoSpace"] would be the string USS Enterprise.

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

/* 
Read the values of the properties an entree and the drink of testObj using
bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.
*/

// Setup
const testObj = {
    "an entree": "hamburger",
    "my side": "veggies",
    "the drink": "water"
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
const entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Change this line
const drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Change this line
