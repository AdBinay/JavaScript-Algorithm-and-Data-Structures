    //Store Multiple Values in one variable using javaScriot Array.
/*
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
*/

//Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order)

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ["Binay" , 77];
