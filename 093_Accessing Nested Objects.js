// Accessing Nested Objects

/*The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.

Here is a nested object:

const ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};

ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;
ourStorage.desk.drawer;
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2 would be the string secrets, and ourStorage.desk.drawer would be the string stapler.*/

/*
Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use dot notation for all properties where possible, otherwise use bracket notation.
*/

const myStorage = {
    "car": {
      "inside": {
        "glove box": "maps",
        "passenger seat": "crumbs"
       },
      "outside": {
        "trunk": "jack"
      }
    }
  };
const gloveBoxContents = myStorage.car.inside["glove box"];
