// Nest one Array within Another Array

/* You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array. */

// Create a nested array called myArray.

const myArray = [
    ["Bulls",23], //array item 1
    ["White Sox",45] //array item 2 .....
